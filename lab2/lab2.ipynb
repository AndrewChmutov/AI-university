They're unable to distinguish whether a state is easy or hard to reach, or whether it is near or far of the goal. This makes them very inefficient search algorithms. To allievate the issue, we introduce informed search algorithms. The information is given to an algorithm in two ways:\n","\n","1. By using an *action cost* function $c(s,a)$, which, given a state $s$ and an action $a$ available in this state, returns its cost as a non-negative number.\n","2.

The heuristic should fulfil triangle inequality, that is, the estimated cost to reach the goal from $s$ should be no greater than the cost of executing the action $a$ + the estimated cost of reaching the goal from the new state.\n","$$ h(s) \\leq c(s, a) + h(s') $$\n","\n","One can prove that admissibility follows from consistency, but consistency is important only if there are multiple paths to reach the same state (i.e., we are searching in a graph, not in a tree).
