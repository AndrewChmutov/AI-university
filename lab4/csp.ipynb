{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Constraint satisfaction problem"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["In the previous tasks the state was opaque: an algorithm could execute an action and transform a state to another state, but that was it. It could not depend in its search on the details of a state, because the state representation was different from problem to problem. In CSP this is no longer true: the state always consists of an assignment of values over some domains to variables. This enables an algorithm to interact with the state directly, not only through opaque actions. \n","\n","Allowed assignments are limited by constraints in the problem and broadly speaking they can be divided into three groups:\n","\n","* *Unary constraints* each concerning only a single variable (e.g., $x>0$)\n","* *Binary constraints* relating two variables to each other (e.g., $x>y$)\n","* *General constraints* concerning more than two variables at once\n","\n","In general, the shape of constraints is unrestricted and we are not limited to numeric domains and constraints in the form of inequalities. In principle, one could employ arbitrary boolean functions as constraints.\n","\n","The following class `CSP` is a very limited representation of such a problem capable only of handling:\n","\n","* finite domains that can be materialized (e.g., the set of all 32-bit integers is doable in theory; the set of all 64-bit integers is out of reach) \n","* unary constraints by setting the domain of a variable appropriately;\n","* binary constraints defined in terms of Python's operators `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>` and `>=` such that both sides are variables.\n","\n","About its methods:\n","\n","* The constructor (`__init__`) requires no arguments.\n","* `addVariable` requires two arguments: \n","    * `var` - a variable (a string representing its name, but really, it could be any object);\n","    * `domain` - a collection of the allowed values for the variable\n","* `addBinaryConstraint` also requires three arguments:\n","    * `var1` - a variable, the left-hand side of the constraint\n","    * `op` - an operator (one of the following strings: `'=='`, `'!='`, `'<'`, `'<='`, `'>'`, `'>='`)\n","    * `var2` - a variable, the right-hand side of the constraint\n","* `verify` is used to verify whether the relation given by the second argument `op` holds between the values given as the first argument `left` and the third argument `right`. Returns `True` if it does and `False` otherwise.\n","* `is_complete` gets a single argument: a dictionary representing an assignment of values to variables. From now on, we call such a dictionary an *assignment*. It returns `True` if all the variables of the problem are present in the dictionary, and `False` otherwise.\n","* `is_consistent` also requries an assignment. It returns `True` if all the values in the assignment are such that they come from the respecitve domains, and no binary constrain is violated (but if the assignment is not complete then some may be unfulfilled)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["class CSP:\n","    def __init__(self):\n","        self.domains = {}\n","        self.binary = []\n","    \n","    def addVariable(self, var, domain):        \n","        assert var not in self.domains\n","        self.domains[var] = set(domain)\n","        \n","    def addBinaryConstraint(self, var1, operator, var2):\n","        assert var1 in self.domains\n","        assert var2 in self.domains\n","        c = (var1, operator, var2)\n","        self.binary.append(c)      \n","        \n","    def verify(self, left, op, right):\n","        if op[0] == '=':\n","            return left == right\n","        if op == '!=':\n","            return left != right\n","        if op == '<':\n","            return left < right\n","        if op == '<=':\n","            return left <= right\n","        if op == '>':\n","            return left > right\n","        if op == '>=':\n","            return left >= right\n","        \n","    def is_complete(self, assignment):\n","        return self.domains.keys() <= assignment.keys() \n","        \n","    def is_consistent(self, assignment):\n","        for var, value in assignment.items():            \n","            if value not in self.domains[var]:\n","                return False\n","        for var1, op, var2 in self.binary:\n","            if var1 in assignment and var2 in assignment:\n","                if not self.verify(assignment[var1], op, assignment[var2]):\n","                    return False\n","        return True"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Coloring Australia"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Lets model a map coloring problem.
